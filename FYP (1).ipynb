We have to send them as a message content which we need to process the original dataframe which splits up into several strings so that gpt can receive these messages. The reason for splitting is  so that we don't exceed the tokens which the gpt api can process.

We then measure the metrics for the actual vs predicted results with the actual being the df2['IPO_Price'] Values and the predicted values being mean values of the IPO_Prices. The MSE,MAE,RMSE and MAPE are shown as below which are 84.45,6.40,9.19,0.45 respectively. For the machine learning model to prove its worth, it would have to be better results than the baseline model."

        "For the training of the graph neural network (GNN) model, the loss function used will be the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measures the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. MAE is an important metric for evaluating model performance in regression tasks because it provides a straightforward measure of how well the model's predictions match the true values. By comparing the MAE of the GNN model to that of a baseline model, we can determine if the GNN model provides better predictive accuracy"
