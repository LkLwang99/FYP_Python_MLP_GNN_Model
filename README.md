# FYP - Machine Learning And Neural Networks For MLP and GNN Models (Gathering Your Own Dataset)

The machine learning task require us to collect our own dataset and implement a machine learning model to define the relationships between the variables and the label.
## 1)Introduction

The task is of gathering my own dataset which i have chosen to do would be by creating a synthetic dataset which is used to predict start-up valuations with the help of large language models. The problem statement that I had came up with is by creating 
a synthetic dataset that is used by the machine learning model to predict start-up valuations. The synthetic dataset is generated by GPT-4 as demonstrated in the project and GPT-4 has been fed company data which has been retrieved from yfinance api and data from stockanalysis.com
<br>
With this, we began on developing both Multilayer Perceptron and the Graph Neural Network Model

## 2)Goals And Objectives
The objectives of this project would be 
- Collecting initial Dataset from APIs and Websites
- Feeding the Dataset to GPT-4 to generate Synthetic Data
- Implementing The Baseline Model
- Implementing A Machine Learning Model
- Evaluation Of The Machine Learning Model
- Hypertune Parameters Of The Machine Learning Model

## 3) Understanding The Datasets
The machine learning model began with us extracting information from the relevant websites and APIs which we have the following dataset with column names as shown here: \
[Date,Ticker,Company Name, IPO Price, Current Price, Price Change, Sector, Industry, SharesOffered,TotalRevenue,TotalAssets]
